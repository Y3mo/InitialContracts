//------\\
//---These Contract Configurator configs by nightingale and Yemo are based upon the general contracts of the SETI-BalanceMod: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130 ---\\
//---The mod Contract Configurator http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604 by nightingale is required to use the configs.---\\
//------\\
//---License: You may do what you want (change, expand, mix, redistribute as part of a larger package etc.), as long as you
//---provide the source (eg. SETI-BalanceMod with link) and credit for previous authors (eg. nightingale and Yemo) within the file(s) and at the reference locations (forum thread and download site)---\\
//------\\
//---Thus you can just redistribute this file along with eg a tech tree mod under any (even a very restrictive) license as long as you give credit in the form mentioned above.---\\
//------\\
//------\\
//---Modding Information:---\\
//---All 3 contracts are independent of the vessel type, they can all be completed by probes and manned vessels.---\\
//---The "agent" is the same as the one providing the stock contracts, thus no special flag or agent config is required---\\
//---All 3 contracts are cancellable and declinable for easier bug fixing, they just reappear in the list if cancelled/declined---\\
//---The contracts have progression variables included, which are stored in the persistence file (savegame). They are not required by anything at the moment, but make possible extensions easier.---\\
//------\\
